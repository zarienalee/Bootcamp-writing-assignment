When I think about my future career I see a future which is stable. I would be able to return to therapy and medication. This would make my life a whole lot easier as I could continue my healing journey and with medication could perform at my optimum level more consistently. It has always been one of my dreams to buy my mother a house and if I have a high value career then she would finally have a permanent residence. After a few years I could complete my English degree and would like to start a blog to empower others. To show young girls and women that even after trauma and mental illness one can still have a good career and that they are not alone in their pain and struggles. My focus in life has always been to uplift myself and women like me and this could be further achieved by starting an initiative through big companies or a charity to give girls from impoverished backgrounds the opportunity to learn how to code. This would focus on girls in high school. In regards to coding I see myself in a senior position as my knowledge and experience increases. I have big dreams for my future and know that if I combine my passion for code and my strong desire to reach all future goals, I will succeed.

I have no prior experience in coding, but I do have a lot of experience in working hard and not giving up. My resilience provides me with the strength to never give up and I am no stranger to setbacks. I cope well under stressful conditions as I approach problems and work in a methodical manner. When I am unable to do something I will asses the situation and attempt to sight where the issue is and what is causing it. My next step would be to research the problem I am facing and attempt to rectify my mistake. If I am still unsuccessful I will not waste hours or days on it but will ask for assistance. Being a humble individual, I am not afraid to ask for help and learn from others. I work well in teams and have experience working with others to achieve a common goal. My mind yearns for knowledge. I have always enjoyed learning new skills. When I work through a difficult function and it runs successfully then I feel a strong sense of accomplishment. The hard work is worth it, even on a small scale. This opportunity from Umuzi would accelerate my future career, but in the event that I am not successful in receiving the Umuzi learnership it will not deter me from pursuing my goal of becoming a web developer. It will only mean that I have to work harder and commit more time to improving my skills and eventually one day my dreams will be actualized.

I will have to work consistently each day doing the bulk of the work in the morning and afternoon making sure to sleep on time and taking half of one day off to refresh (Saturday).



I will start planning my week on a Sunday and the following is how each day will typically look.  


*Wake up 7 am.


*Pray.


*Yoga (three times a week).

*Start working at 8 am.


*Take one break - have lunch (30-60 min).


*Continue working until 5 pm.


*Dinner. 


*Evening prayer.


*Do some research on problems faced in the day. Cement knowledge by practicing.  To improve I'll have to put in more than 40 hours in each week. 


*Read for an hour.


*Sleep at 11 pm.


I will have to adjust the above routine if I did not complete the work set out. Extra time can be added at night and on Sundays to be more prepared and to better grasp concepts. On Sundays I can practice what I am learning. I am well aware that coding is new to me and that during the learning process I will have to fully immerse myself into code and that it will monopolize my day.

*Spending time with Jesus in prayer. I start everyday off with a prayer to give thanks and to ask for wisdom on how to go about my day.

*Learning - during lockdown I learnt the basics of HTML and have completed a TEFL course which is used to teach English as a foreign language.

*Reading - I enjoy non-fiction books such as Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less, by Greg McKeown. 

*Watching series and medical documentries - One of my favourite shows to watch is Fresh Prince of Bel Air and the most recent documentry that I've seen is called Diagnosis.

*Exercise - doing yoga during lock-down has kept me centered during the uncertainty. 

*Socialising with friends and family.
